** Unreleased

** [0.0.2a0.dev0] - 2020-03-20

- modules repo is retrieved properly
- fixes porting mistakes in the env and py modules

** [0.0.1a0.dev0] - 2020-03-16

First working version.

*** Growth

- first working prototype
- ~jubeo~ tool configuration file, ~$HOME/.config/jubeo/jubeo_conf.toml~
- ~.jubeo~ project-local configuration files and tool requirements in
- base jubeo repo inside the main source tree made possible by
  relative paths within git repos in the URL fragment
- Commands:
  - ~init-config~ :: initialize the configuration and cache of jubeo
  - ~init~ :: initialize a project with a jubeo metaproject tooling
  - ~update~ :: update the metaproject tooling for a project

- caching is very stupid and not actually cached. Retrieves from git
  repo every time if not local.

** [0.0.0a0.dev0] - 2020-03-12
