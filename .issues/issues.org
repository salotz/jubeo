** TODO 0000: Auto Version Increment                                :feature:

This is a feature that should go in the ~py~ and ~dev~ modules.

Support for:

- date versions
- major, minor, micro
- alpha
- beta
- dev
- rc

version bump only does major minor micro.


Ideas:

- PEGs
- regexes
- staged template files
- comment bounded replacements

Should pick one. I like to be deterministic and debuggable so I prefer
the templates options.

Because we are only replacing small snippets of text out of
potentially large documents I would like use the comment bounded
replacements.

** TODO 0001: Add support for different python versions via pyenv   :feature:

In the python module we want to support using different versions of
python with environments like we can in conda.
